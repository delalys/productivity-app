# Productivity app
I've developed this application to learn Javascript.

[=> DEMO](https://productivity-app-x.herokuapp.com/)

It is entirely in plain Javascript. I have developed it after 1 week of studying.

It represents the state of my skills at that moment, have a look at its code and don't hesitate to compare it to other projects to see my progress! Here is what it is made out of:

* Manipulating Objects
* Manipulating the DOM
* Using UI libraires
* Create, rename and delete features
* State and positioning feature
* Order feature
* Thanks for reading!
